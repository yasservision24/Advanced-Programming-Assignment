## Stick Hero Game
This was the project we had to make in the course Advaanced Programming in the third semester at IIITD.

## How to play the game
To play the game click the mouse and until the mouse is pressed stick keeps growing and once the mouse is released stick rotates to connect to the next platform.
To collect the cherry press the SPACEBAR, by pressing the spacebar chareacter moves down to the stick and able to collect the Cherry.Then after collecting cherry press again the SPACEBAR so that charcater can move above the stick.
Game will be over if the stick lenth is shorter or the charcater is moving downward of stick and platform comes,so while the time character reaches the platform it should be above the stick.
You can revive the game if you have three cherries.
